      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?\n",
      "answer: Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.\n",
      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",

      "question: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\n",
      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

      "answer: The purpose of this document is to capture frequently asked technical questions\n",
      "The exact day and hour of the course will be 15th Jan 2024 at 17h00. The course will start with the first  “Office Hours'' live.1\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\n",
      "answer: Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\n",
      "You can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?\n",
      "answer: Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.\n",
      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\n",
      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

      "question: Environment - The GCP and other cloud providers are unavailable in some countries. Is it possible to provide a guide to installing a home lab?\n",
      "answer: You can do most of the course without a cloud. Almost everything we use (excluding BigQuery) can be run locally. We won’t be able to provide guidelines for some things, but most of the materials are runnable without GCP.\n",
      "For everything in the course, there’s a local alternative. You could even do the whole course locally.\n",

      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Homework and Leaderboard - what is the system for points in the course management platform?\n",
      "answer: After you submit your homework it will be graded based on the amount of questions in a particular homework. You can see how many points you have right on the page of the homework up top. Additionally in the leaderboard you will find the sum of all points you’ve earned - points for Homeworks, FAQs and Learning in Public. If homework is clear, others work as follows: if you submit something to FAQ, you get one point, for each learning in a public link you get one point.\n",

      "section: Workshop 2 - RisingWave\n",
      "question: stream-kafka Qn: Is it expected that the records are being ingested 10 at a time?\n",
      "answer: Ans: [source] Yes, it is so that we can observe the changes as we’re working on the queries in real-time. The script is changing the date timestamp to the current time, so our queries with the now()filter would work. Open another terminal tab to copy+paste the queries while the stream-kafka script is running in the background.\n",

      "\n",
      "section: Module 5: pyspark\n",
      "question: Homework - how to convert the time difference of two timestamps to hours\n",
      "answer: Pyspark converts the difference of two TimestampType values to Python's native datetime.timedelta object. The timedelta object only stores the duration in terms of days, seconds, and microseconds. Each of the three units of time must be manually converted into hours in order to express the total duration between the two timestamps using only hours.\n",
      "Another way for achieving this is using the datediff (sql function). It receives this parameters\n",
      "Upper Date: the closest date you have. For example dropoff_datetime\n",
      "Lower Date: the farthest date you have.  For example pickup_datetime\n",
      "And the result is returned in terms of days, so you could multiply the result for 24 in order to get the hours.\n",

      "section: Module 3: Data Warehousing\n",
      "question: GCP BQ - Can I use BigQuery for real-time analytics in this project?\n",

      "answer: If you are seeing this (or similar) error when attempting to write to parquet, it is likely an issue with your path variables.\n",
      "For Windows, create a new User Variable “HADOOP_HOME” that points to your Hadoop directory. Then add “%HADOOP_HOME%\\bin” to the PATH variable.\n",

      "question: Terraform - Do I need to make another service account for terraform before I get the keys (.json file)?\n",
      "answer: One service account is enough for all the services/resources you'll use in this course. After you get the file with your credentials and set your environment variable, you should be good to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Course - how many Zoomcamps in a year?\n",
      "answer: There are 3 Zoom Camps in a year, as of 2024. However, they are for separate courses:\n",
      "Data-Engineering (Jan - Apr)\n",
      "MLOps (May - Aug)\n",
      "Machine Learning (Sep - Jan)\n",
      "There's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year, for the certification. Same as for the other Zoomcamps.\n",
      "They follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort per zoomcamp. For Data-Engineering it is (generally) from Jan-Apr of the year. If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any zoom camps at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort.\n",

      "answer: It is an internet connectivity error, terraform is somehow not able to access the online registry. Check your VPN/Firewall settings (or just clear cookies or restart your network). Try terraform init again after this, it should work.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Leaderboard - I am not on the leaderboard / how do I know which one I am on the leaderboard?\n",

      "\n",
      "section: Module 2: Workflow Orchestration\n",
      "question: Docker: container crashed with status code 137.\n",
      "answer: It means your container consumed all available RAM allocated to it. It can happen in particular when working on Question#3 in the homework as the dataset is relatively large and containers eat a lot of memory in general.\n",
      "I would recommend restarting your computer and only starting the necessary processes to run the container. If that doesn’t work, allocate more resources to docker. If also that doesn’t work because your workstation is a potato, you can use an online compute environment service like GitPod, which is free under under 50 hours / month of use.\n",
